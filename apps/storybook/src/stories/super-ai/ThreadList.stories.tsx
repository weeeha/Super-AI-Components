 *
 * The walk is followed by the other half of this story's remit — where focus
 * goes on dismiss. Cancelling the delete confirmation returns focus to the
 * row's actions button, which is right, and is worth pinning because the
 * dialog has no trigger element for Base UI to return to: it restores the
 * previously-focused node. Committing a rename does *not* do the equivalent
 * (see `InlineRename`), so this is the one dismissal path that can be
 * asserted rather than recorded.
 *
 * The non-obvious assertion is the opacity one. The trigger is `opacity-0`
 * until the row is hovered — it is a hover affordance by design — and only
 * `focus-visible:opacity-100` keeps it from being an invisible tab stop. That
 * class is one edit away from being lost in any restyle, and nothing else in
 * the pipeline can see it, so it is pinned here rather than described.
 *
 * **Defect recorded, not asserted:** every row's trigger is named "Thread
 * actions" and nothing more, so in a sidebar of ten threads a screen-reader
 * user meets ten identical buttons and only reading order ties one to its
 * thread. The near-twin `record-list` already solves this in the same
 * catalog — it names its overflow trigger `More actions for ${record.title}`
 * — so this is drift rather than an open question. It is *not* pinned below:
 * an assertion that three triggers share one name would have to be deleted to
 * fix the bug. What is asserted instead is the half that is right and must
 * stay right: the three row buttons carry three distinct names.

/**
 * Three row lists that look alike in a sidebar and are not interchangeable.
 * The rule is about who owns a row:
 *
 * - **Thread list** — the *user's* content. Rows appear because someone
 *   started a conversation, are grouped by when they were last touched, and
 *   can be renamed, pinned and deleted by the person looking at them.
 * - **Sidebar nav** — the *product's* destinations. The set of rows is fixed
 *   by the app; nobody renames "Library". It carries what a destination needs
 *   instead: counts, tier badges, and the running spinner for a section with
 *   a job in it — which is the spinner B6's spec asks for and this component
 *   does not have.
 * - **Record list** — rows with *attributes*. Once a row needs metadata, a
 *   run state and an enable toggle it wants columns, and a table is the
 *   honest shape for it.
 *
 * If a row can be renamed by the person reading it, it is a thread. If the
 * product decides the set of rows, it is nav. If the rows need columns, it is
 * a record list.
