 *
 * Writing this shell is what turned "three independent empties" from a
 * sentence into a requirement (`block-build-brief.md`, gate assertion 3), and
 * until this wave it was a sentence here too. The play measures it: all five
 * regions mounted, and three *different* components each rendering their own
 * empty affordance in their own region — L1 in the sidebar, L1 in the stream,
 * J4's own line in the artifact region. They are independent because they
 * empty independently: a returning user with history and no artifacts hits the
 * third alone, and the shell has to be able to say so without the other two.
 *
 * The artifact region is the one that has to be mounted rather than deferred.
 * It is the region a new user has never seen produce anything, so a region
 * that appeared only once it had contents could never teach that it exists.
 *
 * The play also pins the shape behind the stream's `scrollable-region-
 * focusable` exposure, because day one is when it is closest to firing: the
 * accessible name and the tab stop are on the `Conversation` root, and the
 * element that actually scrolls is a different one that
 * `use-stick-to-bottom` owns. `Boundary` has the measurement of what happens
 * when the two come apart.

/**
 * The reduced-motion branch, and where it had to be added.
 *
 * This shell owns exactly one animation — the job-queue spinner beside a
 * running thread — and it shipped with a bare `animate-spin` and no branch.
 * `motion-reduce:animate-none` was added beside it in this wave (spec §3.4:
 * one class, an established idiom, no design decision in it). The assertion
 * was written first and watched fail against the unfixed source
 * (`animation-name: spin`), so this is a guard that has been seen red rather
 * than a class check that could never fail.
 *
 * What the branch is *for* is the second assertion. This shell's own docs say
 * a spinner must never be the whole signal; suppress the spin and all that is
 * left is `runningLabel`, so the word is what carries the fact that something
 * is still working.
 *
 * Everything else that animates here belongs to a composed component and is
 * reached rather than assumed: B6's actions menu and its delete confirmation
 * are opened from inside the shell, and all three surfaces — menu, alert
 * dialog panel, alert dialog backdrop — are read back. The backdrop is the
 * one worth reaching. It is unreachable from any call site
 * (`AlertDialogContent` renders `<AlertDialogOverlay />` with no `className`),
 * so it was fixed centrally in wave 7 after two agents disproved their own
 * steering; this is that fix measured from a consumer four levels above it
 * rather than from the component that reported it.
 *
 * **One surface in this shell was still animating under reduce, and it could
 * not be reached from this story.** B1's mobile drawer is a `Sheet`, and
 * `components/ui/sheet.tsx` carried no `motion-reduce:transition-none` on
 * either half. It exists only below the 768px media query, so `Mobile` is
 * where it was measured — and where the guard now lives. Fixed centrally in
 * both copies of the vendored file after this story reported it.

 * Right-to-left. A shell is where direction stops being a per-component
 * question: five regions have to agree about which edge is the start, and
 * nothing in this file reads `dir` — flex order and logical utilities carry
 * all of it.
 *
 * `dir` on a wrapper is enough here, deliberately: this story opens no popup,
 * and the only portalled surfaces the shell can produce (B6's menu and its
 * confirmation, the mobile drawer) are exercised in `ReducedMotion` and
 * `Mobile`. An RTL story that opened one would need `dir` on the document
 * instead (`story-conventions.md`, mechanical fact 5's closing note).
 *
 * **Two classes were swapped in this wave** and are pinned below: the topbar
 * row's `pl-2` and the `pl-1` the shell passes to B7 both became `ps-`. Both
 * close the gap to the sidebar trigger, so both have to follow direction.
 * Byte-identity in LTR was measured rather than assumed — `8px/0px` and
 * `4px/12px` before the swap and after it — because the same swap is not free
 * on an ancestor whose descendants the user agent has an opinion about
 * (`usage-dashboard`, wave 7). The B7 half is the interesting one: its own
 * base is `px-3`, a logical *shorthand*, and the longhand still wins the
 * cascade, which is a property of Tailwind's emitted order and not something
 * a class list shows you.
 *
 * **Recorded, not fixed — the default disclaimer's full stop moves to the
 * wrong end.** N3 `disclaimer-note` measured this in wave 7: the trailing `.`
 * is a bidi neutral with nothing strong after it, so it takes the paragraph
 * level and paints at the far edge, giving `.AI can make mistakes. Check
 * important info`. Wave 7 also found that passing a `link` hides it, because
 * the link's Latin text makes the stop interior — **and this shell forwards no
 * `link`**. `disclaimer` is a bare `React.ReactNode` spliced in as N3's
 * children, so the one workaround that exists is unreachable through the
 * shell's API unless a caller rebuilds the anchor by hand. The measurement is
 * asserted here because it is the shell's own default rendering, and the fix
 * belongs to N3 or to a `link` passthrough — not to a story.
 *
 * **Swept on 2026-09-10, and the entry it closes was wrong about the symptom.**
 * B6's row button carried `text-left` and now carries `text-start`. This
 * description used to say that every title therefore hugged the wrong edge
 * inside a mirrored sidebar, and the play function pinned the computed `left`
 * as the record of it. Measured under both classes while landing the sweep,
 * that was never true: the title span is shrink-to-fit, so `text-align` has no
 * slack to distribute and the glyphs land at `span=70..239` inside
 * `btn=36..247` either way, flush against the row's start edge. The flex
 * direction was already doing the mirroring. The swap is still right — it is
 * byte-identical in LTR and correct in RTL for any row whose title truncates —
 * but what this story can honestly pin is the declaration, not a placement.
 *
 * **Recorded, not fixed, and the serious one — the sidebar paints on the wrong
 * edge and covers the conversation.** The vendored sidebar splits itself into
 * an in-flow `sidebar-gap` that reserves the column and a `fixed`
 * `sidebar-container` that paints it. The gap follows direction because it is
 * in flow; the container is placed by `data-[side=left]:left-0`, which is
 * physical and does not. Measured in the play function: shell `0..1200`,
 * painted sidebar `0..256`, reserved column `944..1200`, stream `0..944` — so
 * 256px of blank space sits at the shell's start edge and the sidebar sits on
 * top of the first 256px of the conversation. This is not the shell's to fix:
 * `left-0` lives in `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`, which every B1 consumer
 * shares, and CONTINUE.md §8's standing rule for a byte-identical swap in a
 * vendored file is that it is not taken from a consumer. It is also not
 * confined to this shell — O1, O9, O10 and O11 compose B1 the same way.

 * **The order is not the one `chat-shell.docs.tsx` states.** That page says the
 * sequence begins "sidebar trigger, `switcher`, one stop per thread row…". The
 * rendered sequence puts the sidebar trigger **seventh**, after the switcher,
 * both thread rows, both row menus and the sidebar footer — because the
 * trigger lives in the topbar row, and the topbar is a sibling *after*
 * `data-region="sidebar"` in the DOM. So the control that collapses the
 * sidebar is reachable only by tabbing through the whole sidebar first, and it
 * gets further away with every thread. Recorded here, asserted as measured,
 * and left for the docs module's owner: prose written from intent, contradicted
 * by rendering it — the same shape as the seven docs corrections in waves 6 and
 * 7. Cmd/Ctrl+B is the real escape hatch and is registered on `window`, which
 * is presumably why nobody noticed.
 *
 * **The composer's suppressed control is genuinely gone.** The shell hides D1's
 * negative-prompt toggle with a `display: none` descendant variant, and the
 * constant's docstring claims that removes it from the tab order rather than
 * merely hiding it. The walk is what proves it: twelve stops, none of them the
 * toggle.
 *
 * **Both focus checks, because they answer different questions.**
 * `settledFocusRing` asks whether anything is painted; the differential —
 * reading the *next* stop's signature while focus is still on the previous one,
 * so nothing disturbs the sequence — asks whether focus is what painted it.
 * `story-conventions.md`, mechanical fact 5.
 *
 * **Two stops are excluded from the ring check and nothing is pinned in either
 * direction**, which is the H2 `time-ruler` precedent: decline the helper
 * rather than manufacture green, and say so.
 *
 * - The message stream is `tabIndex={0}` with no `focus-visible` class of its
 *   own — its docs page already says this. It is the same shape as the
 *   unstyled `Tabs.Panel` that `tool-panel` filters out of its own walk.
 * - D1's composer textarea paints nothing either, which wave 1 recorded on
 *   `media-prompt-bar` itself (`border-none focus-visible:ring-0`, no
 *   container `focus-within`). Measured here from four levels up: outline
 *   `none/1px`, and every shadow layer zero-sized —
 *   `oklab(0.708 0 0 / 0.5) 0px 0px 0px 0px` is a colour with no geometry.
 *   That is the J3 `explore-gallery` shape, so the differential *would* report
 *   a change on it while `settledFocusRing` correctly reports no ring: a third
 *   independent instance of the two checks disagreeing, and the reason the
 *   convention asks for both. Neither is asserted on this stop.

 * keeps an internal value and updates it on every press *whether or not* it is
 * controlled, then renders `valueProp ?? internal`. The rendered tab is
 * therefore correct here, but the component is carrying a second, divergent

 * Every optional text slot on this shell, emptied at once — and the three

 *
 * **`disclaimer=""` deletes the disclaimer in silence.** N3 falls back with
 * `children ?? DEFAULT_TEXT`, and `""` is not nullish, so the sentence
 * disappears while its information icon stays mounted: a shell showing a
 * glyph with nothing to say. The note has no role and no name to lose, so
 * nothing in the pipeline can see it. Wave 7 recorded the same on N3 itself;
 * reached here through a shell prop that is the only way to set it.
 *
 * **`artifactsEmptyLabel=""` empties a live region in silence.** J4's empty
 * line is a `role="status"`, so an empty string leaves an announced element
 * with nothing to announce and an artifact region with no explanation of why
 * it is blank.
 *
 * **`title=""` is the harmless one**, and it is worth naming as harmless: B7's
 * title is not the accessible name of anything, so an empty title is a blank
 * strip in the topbar and nothing more.
 *
 * **`artifactsLabel=""` is a red gate, and it is not rendered here.** Setting
 * it fails axe `empty-heading` outright — "Headings should not be empty",
 * against `<h2 id="…" class="text-sm font-medium"></h2>` — because the shell
 * renders its region label as a heading and points `aria-labelledby` at it.
 * Measured, then removed from the args rather than shipped into the gate, the
 * way H4 `transcript-editor` handles its own red empty string. Two things make
 * it worth writing down. It is the *fourth* pair in this program's
 * one-red-one-silent family and the only one where the difference is a tag
 * name: J4's own session `label=""` was measured silent in wave 5, and the
 * only structural difference is that J4 renders its label into a `<span>`.
 * And the consequence axe catches by accident is not the one that matters —
 * `aria-labelledby` resolving to an empty string leaves the section with no
 * accessible name, so it stops being a landmark, and there is no rule for
 * that at all.
 *
 * **A query-shape trap found while measuring it**, worth having before the
 * next agent repeats it: `getByRole("region")` cannot see this. `aria-query`'s
 * element-role mapping keys on the *presence* of `aria-labelledby`, not on the
 * name it computes to, so testing-library keeps reporting an unnamed
 * `<section>` as a `region` while a browser maps it to `generic`.

 * 375×812, and the width wrapper the other twelve waves used would have proved
 * nothing here.
 *
 * B1's drawer swap keys on a viewport media query — `useIsMobile` subscribes to
 * `matchMedia("(max-width: 767px)")` — so a `w-[375px]` box renders the desktop
 * rail inside it and reports success. `page.viewport(375, 812)` resizes the
 * test iframe itself, which moves `window.innerWidth`, flips the media query
 * and makes React re-render into the other branch. The story asserts the
 * before-and-after on purpose: the rail is present at the gate's 1200px and
 * absent at 375px, which is the difference between the two techniques stated
 * as a measurement rather than as advice.
 *
 * `@vitest/browser/context` is imported *inside* the play rather than at the
 * top of the file. Its real module throws on evaluation outside Browser Mode
 * ("vitest/browser can be imported only inside the Browser Mode") — Vitest
 * swaps in a virtual module, and nothing else does. A static import would
 * therefore blank this story's canvas in the Storybook UI and in
 * `storybook build`'s output, where no such swap happens. A dynamic import is
 * resolved by the same plugin under the gate and is simply never reached
 * anywhere else.
 *
 * What the narrow layout is: no rail, no reserved column, the stream and
 * composer at full width, and the topbar trigger as the only way into the
 * history. The drawer is opened and closed here, so the trigger is proved to
 * be that way in rather than assumed to be, and the play does not return with
 * a sheet mid-dismissal for axe to scan.
 *
 * **This story found the last registry surface still animating under reduced
 * motion, and it is now fixed and guarded here.** `components/ui/sheet.tsx` put
 * `transition duration-200` on the panel and `transition-opacity duration-150`
 * on the backdrop with no `motion-reduce:transition-none` on either, and the
 * `side=left` panel's starting style is `translate-x-[-2.5rem]` — a 40px slide,
 * which is motion by the convention's own test rather than a colour crossfade.
 * It went unfound because nothing could reach this surface before: the drawer
 * branch requires a real viewport media query, so every width-wrapper story in
 * seven waves rendered the desktop rail instead. The fix belongs in the
 * vendored file, which every sheet consumer shares, so the integrator took it
 * in both copies; the play below asserts `transition-property: none` on both
 * halves, which is the value the fix changes.
 *
 * The resize does not leak: `LongContent` above and `Boundary` below both read
 * 1200px back, and `LongContent`'s own assertions depend on it.

/**
 * Beside its nearest neighbour, O13 `notebook-shell`. Both are a conversation
 * with a composer, both keep what the conversation produced on the same page,
 * and they are not interchangeable.
 *
 * **The choosing rule is where the output lives, and it follows from where the
 * input came from.** In O2 the artifacts are cards *inside* the stream, so the
 * conversation is the index of everything it made and history is the only
 * navigation the page needs. In O13 the outputs are a third pane driven by a
 * menu of types, because the notebook is grounded in sources the user supplied
 * first — the left pane is the input and the right pane is a menu, and the
 * chat is what connects them. Pick O2 when the conversation is the product.
 * Pick O13 when the user brings a corpus and the answers have to cite it.
 * O9 `artifact-shell` is the third point on the same axis and is not rendered
 * here: it is the index O2's cards open *into*, a separate destination for
 * when there are more artifacts than one session's worth.
 *
 * The structural difference is asserted rather than described, because it is
 * the part a refactor would quietly lose: O2's artifact region is a
 * *descendant* of its message stream and O13's outputs pane is a *sibling* of
 * its chat pane. Move either one and the shell has become the other.
 *
 * Both are live, not screenshots, so axe sees two shells' worth of landmarks
 * at once — which is its own check: `landmark-unique` is a rule H5
 * `frame-strip` tripped by rendering two of itself, and two different shells on
 * one page is the shape a real product with an embedded assistant reaches.
 * Nothing fires; two shells coexist.
 *
 * **Found while writing this, and belonging to O13 — the latent
 * `scrollable-region-focusable` failure is real and now measured.** O2's block
 * brief predicted it for "any stream genuinely empty of controls": AI
 * Elements' `Conversation` carries the region's tab stop and accessible name,
 * while the element that actually scrolls is one `use-stick-to-bottom` owns
 * inside it. Rendering O13 here with a single plain user turn failed axe
 * outright — `div[data-region="chat"] > .overflow-y-auto.h-full`, "Scrollable
 * region must have keyboard access" — because that inner element scrolled with
 * no focusable descendant. The fixture now carries a grounded answer, whose K6
 * citations are focusable, which is both what O13 is *for* and the reason the
 * defect stays latent in practice. It is the fifth instance of this shape in
 * the registry after `shortcuts-sheet`, the `data-views` kanban, the vendored
 * table and `run-inspector`. O2 is in the same position and survives for the
 * same reason: its stream holds N1's thumbs and J4's cards.

 * embedded case and the one that used to hide the sidebar's bottom slots.
 *
 * `CONTINUE.md` §8 records that this assertion existed only on `HomeShell` and
 * that `chat-shell` "forwards `sidebarFooter` to `AppSidebar`'s `footer` prop
 * identically to `HomeShell` and could reuse `EmbeddedWithSidebarFooter` almost
 * verbatim". Checked against both sources in this wave, and it is still true:
 * both pass `footer={sidebarFooter}` to `AppSidebar` unchanged, and both roots
 * carry the same `EMBEDDABLE_SHELL` + `SIDEBAR_FILLS_SHELL` pair. So this is
 * `HomeShell`'s story with the component swapped and nothing else changed.
 *
 * The assertion is geometric rather than a class check: the footer's box has
 * to sit inside the shell's box. A class assertion would pass against a
 * constant that had been deleted from the `cn()` call and left declared —
 * which is the failure mode worth guarding, because `SIDEBAR_FILLS_SHELL` is
 * the half of the fix that nothing else would notice going missing.
 *
 * The frame is queried by `data-testid`, not `canvasElement.firstElementChild`:
 * the meta decorator already wraps every story in its own `h-svh` div, so the
 * first child of the canvas is that wrapper, not this story's frame.
