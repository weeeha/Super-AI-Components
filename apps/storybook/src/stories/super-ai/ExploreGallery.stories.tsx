/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Case stories — the situations a community feed meets in a product, as

 * docs/design-system/story-conventions.md.
 *
 * Seven of the eight are written. The one that is not:
 *
 * // case-skip: ReducedMotion — grepped the whole composed tree: no keyframes anywhere, and every transition is a colour or opacity crossfade that moves nothing
 * `grep -n "animate-\|transition-"` over `explore-gallery.tsx` and both
 * registry components it composes returns four hits and no `animate-*` at
 * all: `transition-opacity` on the tile action strip (`opacity-0` →
 * `opacity-100` under `group-focus-within`/`group-hover`),
 * `transition-colors` on a sort tab, `transition-colors` on
 * `media-prompt-bar`'s root, and `transition-colors motion-reduce:transition-none`
 * on `choice-chip`, which already carries its own branch. Nothing changes
 * position or size, so this is the `reset-affordance` case the convention's
 * mechanical fact 3 names — the qualifier "a transition a user would
 * perceive as motion" is the load-bearing half, and a fade does not clear
 * it; adding the class here would be adding it to look thorough. The two
 * `transition-all`s in the tree are on the vendored `Button` and `Badge`,
 * which `CONTINUE.md` §8 records as a primitive-wide posture no case story
 * fixes. `vitest.config.ts` already emulates reduce for every test, so a
 * story here would render pixel-identical to `DockedPrompt`.

/**
 * Right-to-left. Almost all of this component mirrors for free, and the
 * exceptions are the point of the story.
 *
 * **Mirrors on its own.** The masonry is CSS multi-column, which flows along
 * the inline axis, so column one becomes the *rightmost* and DOM order still
 * matches reading order: in the 832px frame below the first tile's right edge
 * lands on the list's right edge and every other column sits to its left. The
 * `w-fit` sort tablist hugs the same start edge, and the pill row and tile
 * meta row follow it too, none of them with any direction-aware code.
 *
 * **Fixed in-wave.** The facet count beside a type pill was `ml-1.5`, a
 * physical margin — `CONTINUE.md` §8's sweep table listed it and it is now
 * `ms-1.5`. It is byte-identical in LTR and the assertion below reads the
 * used margin back on both sides so the swap cannot silently regress, which
 * is H3 `track-lane`'s pattern.
 *
 * **What the swap buys, and what it costs.** Measured against the old class
 * with an Arabic facet label (`الكل`, count 240) in a 71px pill: the label run
 * is RTL so the count paints to its left, at 778–801, and `ml-1.5` put the 6px
 * at 772–778 — against the chip's own padding, with the digits touching the
 * label. `margin-inline-start` resolves to `margin-right` here, which is the
 * side the label is on, so the swap is what separates them. The cost is the
 * mixed-script case rendered below: with a Latin label the bidi algorithm
 * keeps "All 240" as one left-to-right run, and a logical margin still
 * resolves against the container's `direction`, so the gap moves to that
 * run's trailing edge. H4 `transcript-editor` recorded the same collision on
 * a second component, and there is likewise no API here separating the
 * chrome's direction from a label's language.
 *
 * **The tile's two corners mirror, since the 2026-09-10 sweep.** The type
 * badge is `absolute top-2 start-2` and the action strip `absolute top-2
 * end-2`, so under RTL the badge sits on the visual right with the title and
 * author beneath it, and the actions on the left. Both participants are
 * classes and nothing else — no inline style, no JavaScript axis, no clip
 * geometry — decides that side, which is what made the swap byte-identical in
 * LTR. Before the sweep this story recorded the pair as _not_ mirroring; step
 * 4 now pins the mirrored placement as correct.

/**
 * The whole tab sequence, and the answer to the question `infinite-scroll`
 * raises: **yes, a keyboard user can reach page two — but only after every
 * control on page one.** Fourteen stops here, in this order:
 *
 * 1–4 the docked prompt (textarea, Attach, Add negative prompt, Create),
 * 5 the sort tablist — *one* stop, because Base UI's `Tabs` is a composite
 * with a roving index, 6–8 the three type pills, which are *three* stops
 * because A4 `choice-chips` ships `role="radiogroup"` with a `TODO: roving
 * tabIndex` and none, 9 the feed itself (`Tabs.Panel`, `tabIndex=0`),
 * 10–13 the two tiles' Open and Remix buttons, and 14 Load more.
 *
 * So the cost of reaching page two is linear in the page you already have:
 * two tiles put four stops in front of the button, and the docs module's
 * thirty-tile figure puts sixty. Load more is reachable, which is the spec's
 * fourth decision holding, and it is the only route — nothing binds a
 * shortcut to it.
 *
 * **Two exclusions from the focus-treatment check, both measured, neither
 * asserted in either direction.**
 *
 * - *The selected type pill paints the same treatment focused and
 *   unfocused.* `choice-chip` gives a selected chip a permanent
 *   `ring-ring border-ring ring-2` and its focus style is `focus-visible:ring-ring
 *   focus-visible:ring-2` — the same colour at the same width. Read back, the
 *   two `box-shadow` strings are byte-identical (`oklch(0.708 0 0) 0px 0px 0px
 *   2px`); only `outline-width` moves, from 3px to 1px, under an
 *   `outline-style: none` that paints neither. This is H6 `waveform-editor`'s
 *   "permanent shadow reading as a ring" in a shared component, so it reaches
 *   every `choice-chips` consumer, not only this feed.
 * - *The prompt textarea paints nothing, and here the differential is the
 *   weaker check.* `media-prompt-bar` sets `border-none
 *   focus-visible:ring-0`, which wave 1 recorded. What is new is the shape:
 *   focus does change the signature — one composed layer goes from
 *   `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 0px 0px 0px 0px` to `oklab(0.708 0 0 / 0.5) 0px 0px 0px
 *   0px`, so the colour arrives while the geometry stays at zero. So
 *   `focusTreatmentSignature` reports a change and `settledFocusRing`
 *   correctly reports no ring. The two checks are complements, not
 *   alternatives, and every other stop below is held to both.
 *
 * **Recorded and not asserted:** when the last page lands and `hasMore` flips
 * to false, Load more unmounts under the focus and focus falls to `<body>`.
 * The docs module carries it; asserting it would make it permanent. What is
 * asserted is the good half — while `hasMore` stays true the button keeps
 * focus across the re-render and the live region says so.

 * Three controlled pairs, held the hard way: the host records what the feed

 * The third pair is why this story earns its place. The docs module's fourth
 * pitfall says a host that controls `promptValue` and forgets to apply
 * `onPromptValueChange` gets a Remix button that appears to do nothing — this
 * is the only place that is measured. Remix fires `onPromptValueChange` with
 * the tile's prompt and the field stays empty until the host applies it,
 * which is correct controlled behaviour and also a foot-gun with no visible
 * symptom.
 *
 * The sort and type pairs are the same claim on the two axes the spec insists
 * stay separate: clicking a tab does not reorder, clicking a pill does not
 * filter, both callbacks still carry the value a consumer needs, and a
 * re-render with unchanged props (proved by the pass counter, not assumed)
 * leaves all three where they were.
 *
 * What is *not* controllable is worth naming beside it, because it is
 * `CONTINUE.md` §8's two entries against this component. The first: prompt,
 * sort tabs, type pills and feed sit under one root with no slots, so a host
 * that wants the feed without the prompt, or the controls without the feed,
 * has `dockedPrompt={false}` and nothing else — O8 mounted it feed-only and
 * hosted the rest itself. The second: J3, J4 and J5 are listed as having no
 * per-item slot. That is the half-true one — `ExploreGalleryItem.actions`
 * takes nodes *beside* Remix, so what is missing is a slot over the tile
 * body, not over the tile's controls.

/**
 * Everything optional left out, plus the empty string in six of the places a
 * caller can put one — three on the component (`openLabel`, `remixLabel`,
 * `feedLabel`) and three on an item (`typeLabel`, `author`, `metric`). `title`
 * is the only required field on an item, and it carries the whole tile when
 * the rest is missing.
 *
 * What holds: a tile with nothing but `id`, `title` and `media` renders a
 * media box and a title, and its open button is still named, because
 * `openLabel=""` degrades the name from "Open Neon city at dusk" to the title
 * alone rather than to nothing. A facet `count: 0` is rendered rather than
 * hidden — the guard is `=== undefined`, so an empty facet says so.
 *
 * What does not, and neither is gate-visible:
 *
 * - **`typeLabel=""` deletes the badge instead of falling back to `type`.**
 *   `badgeLabel = item.typeLabel ?? item.type` treats `""` as a value, so an
 *   item that passes `type: "image"` and an empty display label gets no badge
 *   at all — while `data-type="image"` stays on the tile, so it still filters
 *   and the pill count still includes it. That is the one collapse with a
 *   fallback to lose; `author=""` and `metric=""` also vanish, but they have
 *   nothing to fall back to. Third instance of the shape after H7
 *   `stem-mixer`'s `label=""` and P1 `data-views`' empty group label.
 * - **`remixLabel=""` ships an 18×24px button with no visible content**, named
 *   `": Paper-cut forest"` — the interpolation leaves the colon behind. It
 *   passes `button-name` because the name is non-empty, and WCAG 2.2's
 *   24×24 minimum is axe's experimental `target-size`, which is off. So
 *   nothing catches it in either direction. Measured below, not repaired: the
 *   default is `"Remix"` and choosing a fallback is an API decision.
 * - **`feedLabel=""` leaves `role="region"` with `aria-label=""`.** Asserted
 *   below as the unnamed region it is.
 * - **A facet count has no textual separator from its label.** The count is a
 *   bare `<span>` set off by a margin, and a margin is not whitespace, so the
 *   accessible name of a type pill computes as `"All0"` — and, on the fixture
 *   the other stories use, `"Images180"` and `"Video60"`. Third instance of
 *   the shape H4 `transcript-editor` found (`gap-x-1` in place of a space,
 *   giving `"Sothesecondpass"`). Recorded here rather than asserted, so a fix
 *   does not have to come back and delete a test; every story in this file
 *   addresses pills by position for the same reason.

 * - **A tile title and author truncate.** They sit in a `min-w-0 flex-1`
 *   column with `truncate`, so the meta row keeps its one-line height and the
 *   tile keeps the geometry the masonry packing depends on. There is no
 *   `title` attribute, so the full string is unreachable by hover — the same
 *   gap D3 `context-chips` records.
 * - **A sort label neither wraps nor truncates.** `Tabs.List` is `w-fit` and
 *   each tab is `whitespace-nowrap`, so the tablist grows with the label and
 *   nothing bounds it: one 83-character sort plus a three-character one
 *   measures 650px, against 375 for a phone column. A third long sort clears
 *   this story's own 832px frame, and there is no scroll container to catch
 *   it — the B4 shape (`whitespace-nowrap` under a fixed height) reached from
 *   the width side.
 * - **A type pill wraps.** `choice-chip` sets no `whitespace` rule and
 *   `ChoiceChips` is `flex-wrap`, so the same length grows the pill's height
 *   rather than the row's width. Two composed controls, opposite answers,
 *   which is a second reason the spec keeps the two axes as two controls.
 *
 * The fifth slot belongs to a composed component and is cited rather than
 * re-measured: `media-prompt-bar`'s textarea is `field-sizing-content
 * min-h-16`, and wave 1 measured that the floor absorbs two wrapped lines
 * before the field grows at all.

 * 375px, and the first thing to say is what this story does **not** prove.
 *
 * The gate's chromium is 1200×900 and the frame below is a wrapper, so
 * `sm:columns-2` and `lg:columns-3` both still match: the masonry renders
 * **three** columns of about 114px inside a 375px box, where a real phone
 * gets one. So the claim here is the stronger, stranger one — the desktop
 * three-column layout squeezed into a phone's width still does not scroll
 * sideways, on the frame or on the component's own root. The convention's
 * mechanical fact 2 is why the wrapper is used anyway, and why the frame
 * rather than the centring decorator is what gets measured.
 *
 * What is genuinely narrow-only and holds: the pill row wraps to fill the
 * width instead of overflowing, the `w-fit` sort tablist still fits at 164px,
 * and `media-prompt-bar`'s toolbar is `flex-wrap`, so the Attach / negative /
 * Create row stacks rather than pushing the bar wider than its column.
 *
 * A three-column masonry at 114px per column is the case the spec's own
 * layout argument breaks down in — tiles that narrow carry no surprise —
 * which is a reason for a host to force `layout="rows"` on small screens, and
 * the component has no breakpoint of its own to do it with.
 *
 * That is not a quirk of the harness. `sm:columns-2 lg:columns-3` are viewport
 * media queries, so the same three columns land in any 375px *container* on a
 * desktop page — a feed beside a sidebar, or in a modal. `CONTINUE.md` §8
 * records "grid columns keyed off the viewport rather than the container" for
 * J4 `artifact-grid` and C4 `recent-grid`; this is a third instance, and it is
 * not on that list.

/**
 * Against C4 `recent-grid`, the near-twin this component's own pitfalls warn
 * about by name. Both are grids of thumbnail cards with a title, a hover
 * action strip and an open control, and from a screenshot they are the same
 * component.
 *
 * The rule is **whose work it is, and therefore whether the frame is fixed**:
 *
 * - **Explore gallery** is other people's finished work, browsed for
 *   surprise. Heights vary per item, so it owns its own tile and cannot
 *   compose A8 `preview-tile`; it carries a sort axis, a type axis and a
 *   docked prompt, because the point of the surface is to convert a browse
 *   into a generation without a navigation step.
 * - **Recent grid** is your own projects, returned to on purpose. It composes
 *   A8, so every card is one aspect ratio and the grid never reflows; it has
 *   no filter axes and a first-class empty tile, because a private list is
 *   usually short and often zero-length.
 *
 * So: unequal heights and a reason to prompt → J3. Equal frames and a reason
 * to resume → C4. Reaching for A8 inside J3 turns it into C4, which is the
 * second pitfall on this component's docs page.
 *
 * The third neighbour is J4 `artifact-grid`, which is not rendered here
 * because it is not a thumbnail surface at all: its excerpt *is* the content
 * and the card carries no media box, so nothing about it reads as this
 * component from a screenshot.
 *
 * One thing this pairing makes visible that neither component documents: two
 * explore galleries without `sorts` on one page are two `role="region"`
 * landmarks both named "Community feed", which is H5 `frame-strip`'s
 * `landmark-unique` shape. The gallery in this story carries `sorts`, so its
 * feed is a `tabpanel` and the question does not arise — that is the escape
 * hatch, and nothing in the component or its docs says a caller needs one.
