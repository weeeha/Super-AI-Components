/**
 * Feature Card Row — "Popular features" / "Start from scratch"
 *
 * Spec: docs/design-system/component-specs.md#c3-feature-card-row
 * States: icon-title-desc · with-thumbnail · horizontal-scroll
 *
 * D13 (docs/design-system/decisions.md): cards here are A9 `entity-row` in a
 * card layout — the same four slots (icon, title, description, trailing),
 * stacked vertically instead of horizontally. `FeatureCard` below composes
 * `EntityRow` rather than reimplementing those slots: only flex direction,
 * alignment and padding change to turn the row into a card face. The
 * icon/thumbnail split, and the horizontal-scroll behavior itself, live
 * outside `EntityRow` because neither is part of its four-slot contract.

      {/* The visible next affordance the spec calls out: trackpad-only
          scroll hides half the row, and Carousel's role="region" plus
          arrow-key handling is what keeps the row keyboard reachable.

          The vendored arrows sit at -left-12/-right-12, outside the carousel's
          own box. That is right for a full-bleed row and wrong in any
          constrained column, where it clips or forces a horizontal scroller.
          Overriding here rather than in the primitive: components/ui is
          vendored and stays byte-identical to upstream.

          Vertically centered (the vendored default) lands the arrow on top of
          the card's title text at any scroll position, since the title sits
          near mid-card height and the button is wide enough to reach it. Top-
          anchored instead: it only ever touches the icon/thumbnail above the
          title, never the text.

          The `!important` on `!top-2` is deliberate, not sloppiness: what it
          defeats is `inset-y-0` surviving `cn`'s tailwind-merge pass, because
          tailwind-merge does not treat `top` and `inset-y` as the same
          conflict group, so a plain `top-2` would sit alongside `inset-y-0`
          in the class list with no guarantee which one's `top` declaration
          wins in the generated stylesheet. `!important` removes that
          ambiguity outright rather than relying on it. `my-0` is required
          alongside it for the same reason: `inset-y-0`'s surviving `bottom-0`
          plus the vendored `my-auto` re-centers the box through the CSS
          auto-margin formula for absolutely-positioned elements even once
          `top` is pinned, unless the auto margins are zeroed too.

          This registry ships owned source, not a compiled package: a
          consumer who needs different arrow placement edits these two lines
          directly, the same way they would any other call-site override in
          this file.

          H5 frame-strip deliberately does NOT carry this `!top-2 my-0`
          pair, and the reason is narrower than "the label is somewhere
          else": its tile's label is an *overlay* band on the tile's own
          bottom edge (A8 preview-tile, labelPlacement="overlay"), still
          inside the same frame the arrow sits over — not a caption below
          it. Its vertically-centered arrow currently clears that band only
          because, in the configuration its own stories exercise without a
          controls row, the item's height is just the tile's height, and the
          clearance is narrow rather than generous. Adding a controls row
          there (onReorder, or the in-out variant) would grow the item and
          pull that centered arrow's middle down toward the label, shrinking
          it further — see that file for the mechanism. Top-anchoring here
          is what makes C3 immune to the equivalent shift: pinned to `top-2`
          rather than centered, this arrow's position never depends on how
          tall the item is, so nothing below it — longer description text,
          an extra row, anything — can move it. The asymmetry between the
          two files is intentional, not a mismatch to reconcile. */}
